### Cover letter writer

```
A cover letter, also known as an application letter, is a small memo provided to employers explaining an applicant's interest in the job and company, and fitness for the role. It's typically submitted along with a resume in a job application. This letter should highlight skills, experience and achievements concerning the position they seek. Unlike a resume, cover letters allow the applicant to go into more detail about their professional career and explain why they're a good fit for the role and company.
